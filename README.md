# Blabber
You know that "friend" that just won't stop talking!? That's true for a lot of our devices as well. This repo provides a suite of tools that sniff, impersonate, and track devices via Bluetooth, WiFi, and other protocols. 

# Motivation
@ DEFCON 2023, event goers were intrigued by the constant request be broadcasted to setup a nearby AppleTV. We were no exception to this and knew we had to figure out how it was being accmplished ASAP. After much research, we found a few PoCs that were similar in nature, but none actually displayed the AppleTV setup functionality displayed at DEFCON. We wanted to fix that and we did!
